# *Sources* for Your Organisation
 
*Sources* is an open source software published under the MIT license: [LINK to license text on github]. You can host your own installation of *Sources* and make it fit your organisationâ€™s needs. We invite you to contribute your developments to the Sources project on GitHub.

You can find the *Sources* repository here: [LINK to github repo]

We are currently looking into launching *Sources* as a cloud service hosted by DOSSIER. This will allow your team or organisation to use *Sources* instantly, without setting anything up. Our aim is to provide *Sources* at a scalable pricing, giving also smaller organisations the possibility to use *Sources.*
