### Learn More About *Sources*

# Prove Your Credibility

News organisations are more than ever accused of publishing wrong or tendentious information. It is not enough for them to plainly insist on telling the truth or to rely on their reputation to distance themselves from those who actually spread misinformation – news organisations have to grow and cultivate credibility actively. *Sources* forestalls doubts and accusations by openly giving the reader the information, documents and datasets a story is based on. In cases of doubt, readers can then fact-check themselves.

# How *Sources* Helps Your Organisation

1. *Sources* makes relevant parts of a source that are crucial to the story easily accessible for readers. Information that is otherwise hard to find and difficult to understand can be put in context and emphasized by an editor and is then laid out in an unobtrusive user interface.
2. *Sources* is an archive that helps you to find and make use of already stored sources, such as documents, images and videos. As a central source hub, it addresses the problem of badly structured filesystems and duplicate documents being spread out via unsafe computers and cloud services.
3. *Sources* has a workflow so easy that it encourages journalists to upload sources and to contribute to the team’s archive. The goal is to turn around the logic of adding sources to a story: With *Sources,* it is already done at the very beginning of the process – and not in the final stage.

# The Editorial Workflow

1. Already at the very beginning of a story – while researching –, an editor can add sources to the archive. During the uploading process, the source is supplemented with additional information in order to structure the sources and to make the archive searchable.
2. In the process of writing, an editor can simply add a link to the story – pointing to the corresponding source. To ensure that editors can stick with their favorite word processor or write the story directly in the respective CMS, no extensions, plug-ins or additional scripts are needed.
3. During the revision of a story, a colleague, such as a fact-checker, can easily retrace and verify the information given in the text by following the links to the sources embedded into the story. Also, when collaborating on a story, the sources used by other editors are transparent and readily accessible.
4. An editor can emphasize parts of a source and add an annotation to give readers quicker access to the relevant information.

# Within *Sources* Confidential Information are Safe

The platform where all the sources are stored and archived is a secure web application, allowing access only for logged-in users to make sure that confidential information is safe. As a default, sources and annotations are flagged as “confidential”, making them only accessible to other users who are logged into *Sources.*

# Measuring *Sources*

*Sources* comes with lightweight statistics:

* Your inventory: overview of the number of Sources, Collections, Stories and Tags 
* “Source views”: the number of Sources that have been viewed in total

The tracking data does not contain any sensitive personal information about your users, making it easy to comply with GDPR. 

Please make sure that your staff agrees to what information about them is stored.

# Under Development

With the help of the open source community, we aim to make *Sources* more powerful and to introduce new features, such as:

* Additional source types:
    * Datasets and spreadsheets
    * Audio uploads
    * Other video platforms
    * Video uploads
    * Links to websites
* Multiple instances of sources to prevent duplicate sources
* Organisations: allowing a user to contribute to various teams from one organisation
* Hierarchical structure: 
    * Projects to which Collections can be assigned
    * Assigning Stories to Collections
* Locking single sources so that only the owner and admins can edit them
* User group fact-checker: granting read-only rights
* Embedding a source directly into the text instead of only making it visible on a click
